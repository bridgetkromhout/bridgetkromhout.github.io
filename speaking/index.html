Description What is your platform? Everyone has one, whether it's Docker wrapped in config management wrapped in thousand-line fabfiles, bespoke artisanal hand-crafted shell scripts… or both! What promises can your platform make and keep? We craft platforms specific to our needs. I'll talk about where I've been (spoiler alert: containers in production without hype) and what I've learned on this journey.

Description Which cloud do we want: public, private, hybrid? How are we going to orchestrate containers? How many pizzas should our teams eat? Should everyone be on call, even front-end? Maybe we should only hire full-stack ninjas? Do we even want to dev some ops, or do we need site reliability instead? Technical decision-making is a sea of bad and worse choices waiting to happen; let’s talk about it.

Description Microsoft issued me a Mac when they hired me to help people use Linux on Azure. If this sounds like the beginning of a nerdy joke, it’s because we need to question long-held opinions, let go of deeply-cherished stereotypes, and welcome this new era of open collaboration.

Here There Be Turtles: Platform Ops in Public Cloud When I joined a startup already in progress as their first ops hire, I got a crash course in cloud operations. Running databases in EC2 without being on bare metal presents its own challenges; we also began using Hadoop and HBase on EMR, with tragicomic results. What monitoring existed was a twisty maze of half-measures, so improving our Mean Time To Lost Sleep required trying new tools and alerting strategies.

Devops is culture enabled by tools, which are necessary but not sufficient. I touch on the history of devopsdays and the motivations that lead orgs to devops, while encouraging orgs to collaborate, communicate, and iterate towards increasing value for their orgs.

Description Designing distributed systems means considering failure scenarios—both likely and less so. Will the network let you down? (Almost assuredly.) Will some portion of your IaaS misbehave? (Have you met computers?) We build in graceful degradation for much of our automation but often neglect the (just-as-essential) human interactions.

The classic “hard problems” of cache invalidation and naming things revolve around our understanding of what’s correct and true and our agreements with one another on scope and relevance.

Cape Town, South Africa
2016-03-10 to 2016-03-11 Description: Containers will not fix your broken culture. Microservices won’t prevent your two-pizza teams from needing to have conversations with one another over that pizza. No amount of industrial-strength job scheduling makes your organization immune to Conway’s Law. Does this mean that devops has failed? Not in the slightest. It means that while the unscrupulous might try to sell us devops, we can’t buy it.

I was a college-student BOFH, an ISP sysadmin, and an academic IT manager. If I wanted a curmudgeonly sysadmin, I could just look in a mirror. Most developers were unlikely to be granted root on any systems whatsoever, and servers were carefully hand-whittled works of art. You know, The Way Things Were. Moving to a role doing operations at a developer-centric startup was both a culture shock and a great learning experience.

2018-06-27 Description It is a truth universally acknowledged that a techie in possession of any production code whatsoever must be in want of a container orchestration platform. What&rsquo;s up for debate, according to noted thought leader Jane Austen, is how many pizzas the team is going to eat.
Let&rsquo;s explore how to create and operate a Kubernetes cluster in order to answer this crucial question.

2014-10-27 to 2014-10-28  As much as we don't want recruiters, marketing campaigns, and sales pitches defining devops, practitioners are more inclined to define what DevOps is not than what it is. Perhaps this is fitting, as DevOps began in the land of famed Belgian surrealist René Magritte. This meta-talk will examine the definitions and negative space around the non-definition of DevOps, through the filter of Magritte's works.

We endeavor to build consistency, availability, and fault tolerance into our distributed systems, but how do we build them into our teams? The human factors in devops require as much attention as do our technical implementations. Collaboration, understanding, trust: we know how important these interactions are in a devops practice, but how do we enable them between disparate team members, especially in a distributed team?

DramaFever uses AWS to power our streaming video platform. We&rsquo;ve been running Docker in production since about October 2013 (well before it even went 1.0). This talk gives an overview of how we use it to make development more consistent and deployment more repeatable. 
My SysAdvent post for 2014 covers this topic in more detail.

At DramaFever, the largest streaming video site for international content, we&rsquo;ve been running Docker in production since October 2013 (well before it even went 1.0). Cutting (maybe bleeding) edge? Sounds fun! But important technology stack decisions are not made by running a Markov text generator against the front page of Hacker News. So, why are we using Docker? Simply put, it makes our development more consistent and our deployment more repeatable.

Fandom has gone mainstream; everywhere we look, nerd culture is celebrated. Transformative works like fan fiction and video remixes are just as likely to end up on a best-seller list (or be riffed on by the original artist on national TV) as to be hidden away in sock-puppet accounts on obscure websites. And as it turns out, writing fanfic taught me valuable lessons and helped form habits that serve me well as an operations engineer.

Description Everyone keeps telling you that containers need orchestration, but you’re not so sure; maybe they could go for some light jazz? Or maybe serverless is here to save us from the tyranny of (virtual) machines, but meanwhile somebody’s gotta kuber some netes, and it’s likely to be you. Let’s take a walk through the cloud native landscape and talk about what’s new, what’s next, and what you need to get started with Kubernetes right now (before sentient machines have a chance to destroy us all).

2015-10-12 to 2015-10-14 After a couple decades of #opslife, Bridget hung up the pager this summer and turned to the dark side. Curious about what working in a marketing role is like for a web operations geek? Let’s talk about what’s different, what’s the same, and what she has been saying to people who assume she’s not technical. When she blogged last fall about the first rule of devops club being “welcome to the club” and asserted that marketing belonged, she had no idea how relevant to her interests that assertion would become!

At DramaFever, the largest streaming video site for international content, we&rsquo;ve been running Docker in production since October 2013 (well before it even went 1.0). Cutting (maybe bleeding) edge? Sounds fun! But important technology stack decisions are not made by running a Markov text generator against the front page of Hacker News. So, why are we using Docker? Simply put, it makes our development more consistent and our deployment more repeatable.

Collaboration. Empathy. Trust. We know how important these interactions are in a DevOps practice, but what if your team has remote members? My company&rsquo;s in Manhattan, and I&rsquo;m over a thousand miles away. Moving from a small startup with everyone around the same table to being a remote operations engineer is a dramatic shift and requires a new approach.

When I joined a SaaS startup already in progress as their first ops hire, what monitoring existed was a twisty maze of half-measures.

Improving visibility into our infrastructure and application performance required trying new tools and changing how we thought about what we were measuring.

I was a college-student BOFH, an ISP sysadmin, and an academic IT manager. If I wanted a curmudgeonly sysadmin, I could just look in a mirror. Most developers were unlikely to be granted root on any systems whatsoever, and servers were carefully hand-whittled works of art. You know, The Way Things Were. Moving to a role doing operations at a developer-centric startup was both a culture shock and a great learning experience.

In the real world, sharing operational responsibility is not as easy as giving developers production access, adding them to an oncall rotation, and saying “good luck!

But what happens when people actually use it, when you find out where your IaaS rate-limits you, and when you can’t just throw (virtual) hardware at your software problems? In a talk equally useful whether you’re dockering all the Dockers, going serverless with lambda functions, or scaling beyond what you’ve seen before, Bridget Kromhout, Timothy Gross, Charity Majors, and John Vincent explore the practical realities in that vast, uncharted space between “waiting for the change control board is probably fine” and “we just implemented a novel time series data store in our spare time.

Science Fiction TV Dinner - Buffy the Vampire Slayer What makes us who we are, as individuals, and as humans? This panel investigates the boundaries between humans and technology, which are increasingly blurred with the growing expansion of wearable tech, augmented reality, pervasive mobile communication and tracking systems, and immersive sociotechnical environments. Approaching these topics within the framework of a fantasy series, and from the perspective of almost 15 years ago, can form a useful starting point for interrogating our current relationship with technology and our own identity.

Continuous Delivery, Microservices, and DevOps are three labels that describe aspects of the same phenomena; the principles and practices of high performing organizations that deliver highly available software, rapidly, at scale.

Continuous delivery has gone from an aspirational nice-to-have to a must-have capability for staying competitive at the edge of innovation. Nearly every automation project sets out to provide self-service deployments for developers with visibility and reliability for operations.

2018-10-29 Description We endeavor to build consistency, availability, and fault tolerance into our distributed systems, but how do we build them into our teams? The human factors in microservices require as much attention as do our technical implementations. Drawing in comparisons from theoretical computer science and practical systems implementation, I’ll explore how building understanding requires a practical application of great tools in a deliberate pursuit of a constructive culture.

Continuous Delivery, Microservices, and DevOps are three labels that describe aspects of the same phenomena: the principles and practices of high performing organizations that deliver highly available software, rapidly, at scale. Whether using configuration management or embracing containers to package workloads, whether in public or private cloud, we need to provide self-service deployments for developers while retaining visibility and reliability for operations.

Description Pivotal Workshop: The Promise of a Cloud Native Platform Continuous Delivery, Microservices, and DevOps describe aspects of the same phenomena: the principles and practices of high-performing organizations delivering highly available software, rapidly, at scale. The Cloud Native advantage provides capabilities allowing organizations to move quickly, reliably, and economically in an end-to-end infrastructure-to-application platform. What promises can your platform keep?

Turtles All the Way Down: Platform Ops in Public Cloud When I joined a startup already in progress as their first ops hire, I got a crash course in cloud operations. Running databases in EC2 without being on bare metal presents its own challenges; we also began using Hadoop and HBase on EMR, with tragicomic results. What monitoring existed was a twisty maze of half-measures, so improving our Mean Time To Lost Sleep required trying new tools and alerting strategies.

Description Artisanally hand-crafting our own container hosting solutions can be a fun learning experience, but for repeatable production use, we want to deploy and manage Kubernetes clusters in a reproducible fashion. Using open source tools like Helm, Draft, Brigade, and Terraform, we can deploy and update our Kubernetes clusters via a trusted, versioned, repeatable process. We’ll discuss what containers and Kubernetes clusters are at a high level, look into the practical application of open source tools to simplify cluster management, and show you how to deploy Kubernetes clusters in a repeatable and portable fashion.
