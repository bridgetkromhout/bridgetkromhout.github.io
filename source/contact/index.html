I'd be happy to discuss speaking (usually about ops & devops topics). Email <a href="mailto:bridget@kromhout.org">bridget@kromhout.org</a>. (<a href="/speaking/info/">bio & headshot</a>)

For <a href="http://devopsdays.org/events/2015-minneapolis/">DevOpsDays Minneapolis 2015</a>, please email me and the rest of the organizers at <a href="mailto:organizers-minneapolis-2015@devopsdays.org">organizers-minneapolis-2015@devopsdays.org</a>.
