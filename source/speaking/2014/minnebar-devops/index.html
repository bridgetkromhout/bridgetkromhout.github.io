Minneapolis, MN<br>

<br><br>
Since a 2009 start in Belgium, <a href="http://devopsdays.org">DevOpsDays</a> events around the world have become a key venue for developers and operations professionals to meet and exchange ideas about their DevOps practice.
<br><br>
This July 17-18, DevOpsDays is coming to Minneapolis! We'll have two days of single-track talks and Ignite presentations about DevOps tools and culture, as well as Open Space attendee-directed round-tables. Join your local organizers for a panel discussion about their involvement with DevOps and a Q&A about the current plans for this summerâ€™s event. Offer your input on what you'd like to see at <a href="http://devopsdays.org/events/2014-minneapolis/">the first Minneapolis edition of DevOpsDays</a>!
