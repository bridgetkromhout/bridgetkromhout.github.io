Fandom has gone mainstream; everywhere we look, nerd culture is celebrated. Transformative works like fan fiction and video remixes are just as likely to end up on a best-seller list (or be riffed on by the original artist on national TV) as to be hidden away in sock-puppet accounts on obscure websites. And as it turns out, writing fanfic taught me valuable lessons and helped form habits that serve me well as an operations engineer. TL;DR: Iâ€™ll explain how to get from Kirk/Spock to AWS/ELB in five minutes.
