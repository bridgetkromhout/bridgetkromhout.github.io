<h3><strong>Speaker Bio:</strong></h3>
<p>Bridget Kromhout is an operations engineer at DramaFever, the largest streaming video site for international content. She's been paying the bills with Unix sysadmin work since the last time 'flannel shirt over babydoll dress' was a trendy look. Her CS degree emphasis was in theory, but she now deals with the concrete (if 'cloud' can be considered tangible). She likes finicky wide-column data stores, stats-driven monitoring, formal grammars, bicycle-powered camping, and butchering pumpkins for home canning.</p>
