<h3><strong>Speaker Bio:</strong></h3>

<p>Bridget Kromhout is a Principal Technologist for <a href="http://pivotal.io/platform-as-a-service/pivotal-cloud-foundry">Cloud Foundry</a> at <a href="http://pivotal.io/">Pivotal</a>. Her CS degree emphasis was in theory, but she now deals with the concrete (if 'cloud' can be considered tangible). After years in site reliability operations (most recently at DramaFever), she traded in oncall for more travel. A frequent speaker at tech conferences, she helps organize the AWS and devops meetups at home in Minneapolis, serves on the program committee for Velocity, and acts as a global core organizer for <a href="http://devopsdays.org">devopsdays</a>. She podcasts at <a href="http://arresteddevops.com">Arrested DevOps</a>, occasionally blogs at <a href="http://bridgetkromhout.com">bridgetkromhout.com</a>, and is <a href="https://twitter.com/bridgetkromhout">active in a Twitterverse near you</a>.</p>
