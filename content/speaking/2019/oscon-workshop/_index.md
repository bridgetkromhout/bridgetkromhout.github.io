Description
<br>
At this point, you’re familiar with Kubernetes 101; you understand jobs and pods, deployments and daemonsets, labels and selectors, and maybe even how to pronounce kubectl (and let us know if you figure that out). Great, what’s next? Join Bridget Kromhout and Aaron Wislang to explore 201-level topics in the Kubernetes ecosystem.
<p>

Going to production with Kubernetes means new considerations, such as role-based access control to meet your organization’s security standards. You may add custom resource definitions for your specific needs and configure pod disruption budgets for availability and resilience. And when considering ongoing operability, you’ll want to look at open source tools like Helm for package management, Brigade for creating event-driven pipelines, and Duffle for installing and managing distributed app bundles in line with the Cloud Native Application Bundle (CNAB) spec; you’ll try these and more. You’ll leave equipped to use Kubernetes with the kind of customizations and tooling you’ll need for production success.
