Description
<br>
Whether you are looking to start coding an application, building onto it, or scaling, technology is always changing. What works best for building something quick? What work best for scaling?. What languages work best for rapid prototyping, and what does scalable infrastructure look like these days? What technology do you use at different stages of building a company (10 users, 100 users, 10,000 users)? Open Source or proprietary? Build on IAAS or PAAS?
<br>
<br>

Join us for a panel of folks who have built applications on a range of technologies at different stages of growth.
