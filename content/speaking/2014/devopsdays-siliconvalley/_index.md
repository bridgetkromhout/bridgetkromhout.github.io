Silicon Valley, CA<br>
2014-06-27 to 2014-06-28
<br><br>

<br>
I was a college-student BOFH, an ISP sysadmin, and an academic IT manager. If I wanted a curmudgeonly sysadmin, I could just look in a mirror. Most developers were unlikely to be granted root on any systems whatsoever, and servers were carefully hand-whittled works of art. You know, The Way Things Were.
<p>
<br>
Moving to a role doing operations at a developer-centric startup was both a culture shock and a great learning experience. I'll discuss what worked for me (and what was challenging!) in terms of my transition to a DevOps practice.
<p>
Spoiler alert: change is scary, but awesome developers on the team make it much easier for an old-school sysadmin to be assimilated into the DevOps of Borg. Wacky hijinx ensue, and there's a hilarious coda: as it turns out, having your startup acquired means that in IT's view, you're the cowboy now! All sorts of empathy potential!
