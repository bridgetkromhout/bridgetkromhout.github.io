Science Fiction TV Dinner - Buffy the Vampire Slayer
<br>
<br>

What makes us who we are, as individuals, and as humans?
<br>
<br>

This panel investigates the boundaries between humans and technology, which are increasingly blurred with the growing expansion of wearable tech, augmented reality, pervasive mobile communication and tracking systems, and immersive sociotechnical environments. Approaching these topics within the framework of a fantasy series, and from the perspective of almost 15 years ago, can form a useful starting point for interrogating our current relationship with technology and our own identity.

Panelists - Dawn Gilpin, Astrid Atkinson, Bridget Kromhout
