Minneapolis, MN<br>

I was a college-student BOFH, an ISP sysadmin, and an academic IT manager. If I wanted a curmudgeonly sysadmin, I could just look in a mirror. Most developers were unlikely to be granted root on any systems whatsoever, and servers were carefully hand-whittled works of art. You know, The Way Things Were.
<br><br>
Moving to a role doing operations at a developer-centric startup was both a culture shock and a great learning experience. Iâ€™ll discuss what worked for me (and what was challenging!) in terms of my transition to a DevOps practice. Spoiler alert: change is scary, but awesome developers on the team make it much easier for an old-school sysadmin to be assimilated into the DevOps of Borg.
