Minneapolis, MN<br>

<br><br>
When I joined a SaaS startup already in progress as their first ops hire, what monitoring existed was a twisty maze of half-measures. The devteam dreaded oncall, and our Mean Time To Lost Sleep was way too low.
<br><br>
Improving visibility into our infrastructure and application performance required trying new tools and changing how we thought about what we were measuring. Join me for a tragicomic journey from the vale of blissful ignorance through the straits of Nagios and into the mountains of Graphite. We'll talk tools and pitfalls, missteps and dead ends, and everything we haven't yet done but should.
<br><br>
Tools covered will include Nagios, StatsD, Graphite, and Sentry, with some digressions into others such as NewRelic and MMS.
