Philadelphia, PA<br>
<span class="date-display-start">2015-12-14</span>
<br>
<br>

Please join Pivotal's Principal Technologists Bridget Kromhout and Casey West as they lead a joint discussion about Cloud Foundry and Docker. Bridget and Casey will cover running Docker images in Cloud Foundry's Elastic Runtime and orchestrating containerized workloads on Lattice.
<br>
<br>
Bridget has years of experience in site reliability operations (most recently at DramaFever). She podcasts at Arrested DevOps, occasionally blogs at bridgetkromhout.com, and is active in a Twitterverse near you.
<br>
<br>
Casey's experience in internet infrastructure, web app security, and design have taught him to be a paranoid UX-oriented, problem solving Internet plumber; his earliest contributions to Perl live to this day on your Mac.
