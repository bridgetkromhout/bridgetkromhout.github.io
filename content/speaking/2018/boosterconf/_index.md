It is a truth universally acknowledged that a techie in possession of any production code whatsoever must be in want of a container orchestration platform. What's up for debate, according to noted thought leader Jane Austen, is how many pizzas the team is going to eat.

Let's explore how to create and operate a Kubernetes cluster in order to answer this crucial question. If you're into dev or ops or some portmanteau thereof, this is relevant to your interests. Weâ€™ll be following an Azure variant based on the open-source k8s training at http://container.training/, as well as trying out AKS (Azure Container Service); there are takeaways no matter which public or private cloud you use.

As our team grows, we're going to need to scale our k8s cluster, deploying and configuring our pizza delivery app. We'll deal with the consequences of state (you know, where your customers and money live) and carry out service discovery between our deliciously independent microservices. We'll level up on k8s (and pizza) together.
