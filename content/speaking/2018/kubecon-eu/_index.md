Description: If you want to level up the k8s game at your organization, maybe what you need is a hands-on workshop. In this whirlwind tour of a successful interactive workshop, we'll look at how to give people a guided hands-on k8s experience. If you're into dev or ops or some portmanteau thereof, this is relevant to your interests. Weâ€™ll be following an Azure variant based on open-source k8s training at http://container.training/, as well as checking out AKS (Azure Container Service); there are takeaways no matter which public or private cloud you use.
