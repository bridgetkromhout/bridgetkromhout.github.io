Description
<br>
<br>
It is a truth universally acknowledged that a techie in possession of any production code whatsoever must be in want of a container orchestration platform. What’s up for debate, according to noted thought leader Jane Austen, is how many pizzas the team is going to eat.
<p>
In this hands-on Kubernetes workshop, Bridget Kromhout uses a pizza delivery app example to walk you through launching clusters and detail all the moving parts you need to know about to use Kubernetes in production. If you’re into dev or ops or some portmanteau thereof, this is relevant to your interests. You’ll use an Azure variant based on the <a href="http://container.training">open source Kubernetes training</a> and get the chance to try out AKS (Azure Container Service)—whatever public or private cloud you use, you’ll learn something valuable.
<p>
As your team grows, you’re going to need to scale your Kubernetes cluster, deploying and configuring your pizza delivery app. Bridget demonstrates how to deal with the consequences of state (i.e., where your customers and money live) and carry out service discovery between your deliciously independent microservices. Join in to level up on Kubernetes (and pizza).
