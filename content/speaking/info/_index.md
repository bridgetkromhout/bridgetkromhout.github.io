After 15 years as an operations engineer, she traded being on call for being on a plane. A frequent speaker and program committee member for tech conferences, she leads the <a href="http://devopsdays.org">devopsdays</a> organization globally and the devops community at home in Minneapolis. She podcasts with <a href="http://arresteddevops.com">Arrested DevOps</a>, blogs at <a href="http://bridgetkromhout.com">bridgetkromhout.com</a>, and is <a href="https://twitter.com/bridgetkromhout">active in a Twitterverse near you</a>.</p>
